  It is within this wider authoritan gesture of selective attribution of meaning and value to site and structure that heritage industries have evolved, such as Switzerland’s Denkmalpflege, Heimatschutz, and ISOS. The tradition, reaching back to the early heritage discourse, allows insight into the practice of power structures reinterpreting the past through selective cultural and ideological lenses that identify what is worthy of preservation according to values and priorities current at any given time. In the 19th century, it was argued that the practical usability of historical buildings should not be considered when cataloging them. This perspective has had lasting consequences, even to this day: it continues to hinder the preservation of neighborhoods of the “common people.” These districts have little or no visual representation of status; therefore, their façades appear humble, especially in comparison to patrician houses or noble palaces.

  Historically, Heritage preservation developed through significant ideological shifts over time-from Enlightenment ideals of scientific objectivity through revolutionary frameworks of selective preservation that set up what is deemed “essential”. By doing so, it defines the raw material into parcels ready for preservation or consumption. Alternatively, they may be labeled as polluted, damaged, and contaminated, thereby becoming targets for reclamation and development as seen in the Altstadtsanierung in Zurich.
  <br><br>
  Within Switzerland, this happened in a landscape of political drive for national unity, wherein heritage becomes embedded in narratives that express an aestheticized and idealized past rather than real social change. With the beginnings of the Heimatschutzbewegung, changing living conditions and production methods were concealed through “kleinbürgerlicher” architecture until this fiction could no longer be sustained. However, the codification of a national identity had already emerged in the context of a manifesto that juxtaposed ideas of a modern, but well-fortified Switzerland with a culture of preservation of the country’s natural heritage.

  The concept of protecting entire urban ensembles was first articulated by Camillo Sitte in 1889. One could argue that this attempt was the starting point of an aesthetic development in which the collective imagination moved so radically away from its means of subsistence that only aesthetic renewal prevented the break. In 1908, under the mandate of the federal government, the Heimatschutz organization designated so-called protection zones for the most prestigious districts of Zurich—areas reflecting not so much the history of settlement but rather the prevailing power structures of the time. This comprehensive approach to protection, however, gained decisive traction in its parallel movement, nature conservation, with the founding of Switzerland’s first national park in 1914.

  It could be argued that heritage preservation was only institutionalized in the wake of large-scale destruction, not as a mere response but as part of a broader initiative. The Athens Charter elevated the value of heritage conservation on an international scale, though its chapters remained shaped by national perspectives.Following the Second World War, the theme of urban reconstruction took on significant momentum. Though cities had been laid to waste, plans for their reconstruction and for the radical reorganization of urban space had already been conceived behind the scenes. Yet, historic city centers retained their symbolic role, anchoring the ideology of organic growth within tangible reality. Consequently, the war-damaged old towns had to be meticulously reconstructed to their original form, a sentiment that later resonated in the eighth CIAM conference, The Heart of the City.

  With the Venice Charter 1964 the formalization of heritage practices shifted the focus from isolated monuments to entire “ensembles,” thereby providing this apparent urban coherence with a solid pictorial content. With the compression of space and time and the increasingly fluid circulation of capital, alongside the growing homogenization of space, a stronger, alternative construction of local identity emerged. Places began to compete for distinctiveness. Viewed from this perspective, the Venice Charter’s principles were no longer assessed nationally but locally. Since the 1970s, the most influential example of assigning meaning—and, naturally, of enhancing value—has been UNESCO’s designation of World Cultural Heritage status to sites, whether urban or natural.
  <br><br>
  Amid the rapid urbanization of the 1970s and the concurrent homogenization and global struggle for identity, a newly established organization known as ISOS (Inventarisation schützenswerter Ortsbilder der Schweiz) emerged as a mediator between these opposing forces. This inventory serves as a snapshot of the so-called urban landscapes of variously sized population centers. Based on the assigned cultural or historical value, preservation goals are set for these landscapes.
  <br><br>
  In our view, the contemporary Heritage Discourse, with its focus on material preservation, expert authority, and static interpretations, often limits a broader understanding of heritage. Rooted in Western nationalist and elite narratives, it overlooks intangible elements, community perspectives, and heritage’s evolving nature. A critical perspective calls for a shift toward viewing heritage as a cultural process intertwined with identity, collective memory, and the meaning of place. The authoritarian approach of separation and segregation, historically imposed by architecture and planning under the influence of politics and industry, gives way to a new paradigm—one of synthesis, openness, and the transcendence of boundaries.
