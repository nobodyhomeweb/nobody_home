    IT IS LESS ABOUT PRESERVATION THAN IT IS ABOUT BRINGING IT INTO THE PRESENT <br>
    THE ARCHIVE DETERMINES THE DISCOURSE - RATHER THAN THE DISCOURSE DETERMINING THE ARCHIVE ( INSTITUTIONS) <br>
    PRESERVATION IS POLITICAL <br>
    STATE VALUATION DEVALUES THE OTHER <br>
    THE THIRD STATE BETWEEN PROTECTION AND CONSUMPTION (LOOKING AT RAW DATA) <br>
    PRESERVATION INSTITUTION AS ORACLE <br>
    A NEW MONUMENT FOR A NEW PARADIGM <br>
    THE LEGISLATIVE INVENTION OF THE CITY AS A LANDSCAPE <br>
    FACTS WERE NEVER ENOUGH (HISTORY) - WE HAVE TO TELL A STORY (HERITAGE) <br>
    FROM SPEAKING FOR CULTURE TO MEDIATING CULTURE <br>
    FROM MONUMENTING DOCUMENTS TO DOCUMENTING MONUMENTS <br>
    PLACE AS THE STRUGGLE BETWEEN LOCAL DWELLING AND GLOBAL CAPITAL FLOWS <br>
    PRESERVATION DESIRES TO TAKE THE HERO BACK TO ITS GLORY DAYS <br>
    TRANSFORMATION DOES NOT NEED A HERO - JUST A STORY TO CULTIVATE <br>
    CAREFULLY CONSTRUCTED IMAGE - MANUFACTURED NOSTALGIA TO CONCEAL THE PROBLEM OF "AGING" IN OUR COMMUNITY <br>
    ITS ONLY A QUESTION BETWEEN THE DEAD AND THE LIVING <br>
    TURNING MAPS INTO THE LANGUAGE OF PROTEST
