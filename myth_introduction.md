IT IS LESS ABOUT PRESERVATION THAN IT IS ABOUT BRINGING IT INTO THE PRESENT

THE ARCHIVE DETERMINES THE DISCOURSE - RATHER THAN THE DISCOURSE DETERMINING THE ARCHIVE ( INSTITUTIONS)

PRESERVATION IS POLITICAL

STATE VALUATION DEVALUES THE OTHER

THE THIRD STATE BETWEEN PROTECTION AND CONSUMPTION (LOOKING AT RAW DATA)

PRESERVATION INSTITUTION AS ORACLE

A NEW MONUMENT FOR A NEW PARADIGM

THE LEGISLATIVE INVENTION OF THE CITY AS A LANDSCAPE

FACTS WERE NEVER ENOUGH (HISTORY) - WE HAVE TO TELL A STORY (HERITAGE)

FROM SPEAKING FOR CULTURE TO MEDIATING CULTURE

FROM MONUMENTING DOCUMENTS TO DOCUMENTING MONUMENTS

PLACE AS THE STRUGGLE BETWEEN LOCAL DWELLING AND GLOBAL CAPITAL FLOWS

PRESERVATION DESIRES TO TAKE THE HERO BACK TO ITS GLORY DAYS

TRANSFORMATION DOES NOT NEED A HERO - JUST A STORY TO CULTIVATE 

CAREFULLY CONSTRUCTED IMAGE - MANUFACTURED NOSTALGIA TO CONCEAL THE PROBLEM OF "AGING" IN OUR COMMUNITY

ITS ONLY A QUESTION BETWEEN THE DEAD AND THE LIVING

TURNING MAPS INTO THE LANGUAGE OF PROTEST
