    >IT IS LESS ABOUT PRESERVATION THAN IT IS ABOUT BRINGING IT INTO THE PRESENT
    THE ARCHIVE DETERMINES THE DISCOURSE - RATHER THAN THE DISCOURSE DETERMINING THE ARCHIVE ( INSTITUTIONS)
    PRESERVATION IS POLITICAL
    STATE VALUATION DEVALUES THE OTHER
    THE THIRD STATE BETWEEN PROTECTION AND CONSUMPTION (LOOKING AT RAW DATA)
    PRESERVATION INSTITUTION AS ORACLE
    A NEW MONUMENT FOR A NEW PARADIGM
    THE LEGISLATIVE INVENTION OF THE CITY AS A LANDSCAPE
    FACTS WERE NEVER ENOUGH (HISTORY) - WE HAVE TO TELL A STORY (HERITAGE)
    FROM SPEAKING FOR CULTURE TO MEDIATING CULTURE
    FROM MONUMENTING DOCUMENTS TO DOCUMENTING MONUMENTS
    PLACE AS THE STRUGGLE BETWEEN LOCAL DWELLING AND GLOBAL CAPITAL FLOWS
    PRESERVATION DESIRES TO TAKE THE HERO BACK TO ITS GLORY DAYS
    TRANSFORMATION DOES NOT NEED A HERO - JUST A STORY TO CULTIVATE 
    CAREFULLY CONSTRUCTED IMAGE - MANUFACTURED NOSTALGIA TO CONCEAL THE PROBLEM OF "AGING" IN OUR COMMUNITY
    ITS ONLY A QUESTION BETWEEN THE DEAD AND THE LIVING
    TURNING MAPS INTO THE LANGUAGE OF PROTEST</h1>/h1>
